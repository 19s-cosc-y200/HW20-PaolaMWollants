#sec-1 { float: left;
         background-color: #DEB887;
         font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
         font-size: large;
         padding: 20px;
       }

2. Write the CSS to configure a class that will produce a headline 
with a dotted line underneath it. Choose a color that you like for 
the text and dotted line.

         color: #FFFFFF;
       }

3. Write the CSS for an id that will be absolutely positioned on a
